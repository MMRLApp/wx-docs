 * ## Getting Started
 *
 * To get started with the WebUI X Utility Plugin, you can install the `wxu` package from npm:
 *
 * ```bash
 * npm install wxu
 * ```
 *
 * Once installed, you can import the necessary modules in your TypeScript files:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { JavaObject } from "wxu";
 * ```
 *
 * > WebUI X uses the MMRL Sanitized Module ID feature. Please visit the [documentation](https://mmrl.dev/guide/webuix/sanitized-ids) for more information.
